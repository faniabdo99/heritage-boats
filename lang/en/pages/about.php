    'community_description' => 'Heritage Boat Clubs bring people together to enjoy the beauty of boats and Iraq’s river and wetland environment, to learn about Iraq’s heritage, and to address relevant issues such as pollution and public access to waterways. The Network connects communities from different parts of the country, and develops relationships with likeminded communities regionally and globally. Through using traditional boats in innovative ways, we also develop job opportunities, build skills, and help to ensure that endangered boatbuilding techniques are passed on to the next generation.',

    'network_description_1' => 'The first stage of the Network includes four Heritage Boat Clubs: Babylon, Baghdad, Basra and Chibayish. During the start-up stage the clubs receive boats, equipment, training and support from the Ark for Iraq programme organised by Safina Projects. Each club is locally managed and organises its own programme of regular training sessions for young people, often in partnership with local colleges and NGOs. Some clubs also have the capacity to host visitors and organise boat trips in their local area.',
    'network_description_2' => 'Each club’s fleet of boats includes several sporting Meshoufs, closely based on the traditional canoes of the Iraqi marshlands. These beautiful boats range from 6m to 10m in length and have the ability to be sailed as well as paddled. Some clubs also use Guffa coracles, the traditional fishing and cargo boats of central Iraq. In each location we are working with local communities to study and, where possible, reconstruct and reintroduce further traditional boat types.',
